# noobProjOne
This is my first project as a NOOB

1. This project is for Windows only

2. I do it because I want to actually CREAT something instead of sitting on my arse all day long
  /* well, I actully did sit on my arse while coding, heh */

3. Download mainTest.exe if you want to just give it a try. Please download the "Codes_QuestionMark" and move it to the same folder as the executable so that the mainTest.exe could run with full functions.

n. More showing-off-and-useless features comming up
